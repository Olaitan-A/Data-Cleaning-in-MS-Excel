# Introduction
This project was inspired by a data cleaning challenge organized by data professionals on twitter, The dataset provided is a messy FIFA21 dataset gotten  from www.kaggle.com. 
FIFA21 is an association football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series.
# About the dataset
A messy dataset of EA Sports' installment of their hit FIFA series - FIFA21 scraped from www.sofifa.com. The dataset has 18980 rows and 77 columns containing details about each player.
# The Cleaning Process
As stated earlier, my choice of tool for the challenge was microsoft excel.

- After assessing the data to understand what needed to be done in order to take it from messy to clean, the dataset was imported into excel through the text import wizard using these steps:
         "Data" tab > "From text/CSV"
         In the "File origin" field, "65001: Unicode (UTF-8)" was selected before loading the data into the excel sheet  
         This step eliminated all special characters earlier noticed in some columns of the dataset during assessment
